# IntroAIFinalProject
The final project for my Intro to AI class.
This program uses a deep learning model to predict the Rotten Tomatoes score of a movie based on multiple factors.
The model was trained on Rotten Tomatoes scores from thousands of movies.
Unfortunately, I was unable to upload the full saved model due to file size limits.
